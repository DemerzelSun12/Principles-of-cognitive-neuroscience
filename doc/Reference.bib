abstract = "Evoked potentials (EPs) are the electrical signals produced by the nervous system in response to an external stimulus. They are used for clinical diagnostic testing and for intraoperative monitoring. Visual, auditory, and short-latency or ‘brainstem’ auditory EPs can be used to assess sensory organs (eyes and ears) and afferent sensory pathways. Sensory EP components can be divided into latency categories, which are differentially affected by attention, cognitive tasks, and anesthesia. Motor EPs can be recorded from muscles or from the spinal cord following transcranial or direct stimulation of the brain; they are used to assess central motor pathways."

Mobile EEG leverages state-of-the-art hardware alongside established advantages of traditional EEG and recent advances in signal processing. In this review, we propose that mobile EEG could open unprecedented possibilities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. We first present a brief overview of recent developments in mobile EEG technologies, emphasising the proliferation of studies in several neuroscientific domains. As these developments have yet to be exploited by neurodevelopmentalists, we then identify three research opportunities: 1) increase in the ease and flexibility of brain data acquisition in neurodevelopmental populations; 2) integration into powerful developmentally-informative research designs; 3) development of innovative non-stationary EEG-based paradigms. Critically, we address key challenges that should be considered to fully realise the potential of mobile EEG for neurodevelopmental research and for understanding developmental psychopathology more broadly, and suggest future research directions."

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relation between the phase of electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha activity at stimulus onset and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a fixed-inter-stimulus interval auditory 'oddball' task, using a novel conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity versus positivity, negative driving versus positive driving, waxing versus waning). METHODS: EEG responses to button-press targets, from 14 subjects presented with 4 blocks of 150 stimuli (50% target probability), were examined. Pre-stimulus alpha activity (8-13 Hz) at Pz was assessed for each trial by digital filtering of the EEG. The alpha cycle at Pz, starting from a negative-going zero crossing, was used to sort trials into 4 phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz, and Pz. RESULTS: Preferred brain states in this paradigm were indicated by an 8% greater occurrence of negative driving than positive driving, and a 33% greater occurrence of waxing than waning phases. Negative driving phases were associated with increased N1 latencies and decreased N2 amplitudes. Latencies of N1 and P2 were reduced in waxing phases. These reflected systematic changes in alpha frequency and amplitude at stimulus onset. CONCLUSIONS: In a fixed-inter-stimulus interval paradigm, component frequencies of the EEG are dynamically adjusted in order to provide brain states at the moment of stimulus presentation which differentially affect the EEG correlates of stimulus processing. SIGNIFICANCE: The results add to our understanding of the genesis of the ERP, indicating the importance of the dynamic interplay between instantaneous EEG activity and stimulus processing reflected in the ERP.},

Pre-stimulus alpha activity at Pz was assessed for each trial by digital filtering from 8 to 13 Hz, and alpha RMS amplitude was used to sort the ERPs at Pz and Cz. A direct relationship was obtained between component amplitudes at both Pz and Cz and pre-stimulus alpha level at Pz.

  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness and comparability of PCA-based simplifications of ERP waveforms versus their reference-free Laplacian transformations for separating task- and response-related ERP generator patterns during auditory oddball tasks.
Methods
Nose-referenced ERPs (31 sites total) were recorded from 66 right-handed adults during oddball tasks using syllables or tones. Response mode (left press, right press, silent count) and task was varied within subjects. Spherical spline current source density (CSD) waveforms were computed to sharpen ERP scalp topographies and eliminate volume-conducted contributions. ERP and CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax) to disentangle temporally and spatially overlapping ERP and CSD components.
Results
Corresponding ERP and CSD factors were unambiguously related to known ERP components. For example, the dipolar organization of a central N1 was evident from factorized anterior sinks and posterior sources encompassing the Sylvian fissure. Factors associated with N2 were characterized by asymmetric frontolateral (tonal: frontotemporal R>L) and parietotemporal (phonetic: parietotemporal L>R) sinks for targets. A single ERP factor summarized parietal P3 activity, along with an anterior negativity. In contrast, two CSD factors peaking at 360 and 560ms distinguished a parietal P3 source with an anterior sink from a centroparietal P3 source with a sharply localized Fz sink. A smaller parietal but larger left temporal P3 source was found for silent count compared to button press. Left or right press produced opposite, region-specific asymmetries originating from central sites, modulating the N2/P3 complex.
Conclusions
CSD transformation is shown to be a valuable preprocessing step for PCA of ERP data, providing a unique, physiologically meaningful solution to the ubiquitous reference problem. By reducing ERP redundancy and producing sharper, simpler topographies, and without losing or distorting any effects of interest, the CSD-PCA solution replicated and extended previous task- and response-related findings.
Significance
Eliminating ambiguities of the recording reference, the combined CSD-PCA approach systematically bridges between montage-dependent scalp potentials and distinct, anatomically-relevant current generators, and shows promise as a comprehensive, generic strategy for ERP analysis.},

Low probability target tones were either counted silently or responded to by a button press. N1 amplitude in the Parkinson group was attenuated to both target and non-target tones suggesting an impairment in early information processing. In contrast amplitudes of P2, N2 and P3 did not differentiate patients from controls. Several peak latencies (P2, N2 and P3) were increased in the Parkinson group when targets were counted, whereas only N2 was delayed when targets were identified by a button press. The longer N2 latency is suggestive of an increase in the time needed to categorize stimuli. The amplitude and latency changes of early ERP components provide evidence for impairment in early information processing in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Previous research examining auditory target ERPs in an inter-modal oddball task has shown that early components are affected by intra-modal processes, whilst components in the later part of the ERP, around 200–400 ms, are affected by both inter-modal and intra-modal processes. These findings led to the conclusion that there are separate stages of auditory target processing — an early modality-specific stage and a later context-dependent stage. The present study investigated this further by simultaneously presenting a visual standard stimulus with an auditory standard stimulus in an oddball task. The aim was to determine whether the inclusion of the visual standard stimulus in this task affected the ERP to targets. The auditory–visual oddball task consisted of a regularly presented combined auditory and visual standard stimulus (80%) and an infrequent auditory target (20%). The ERPs to targets in the auditory–visual oddball task were compared to those in an auditory oddball task, which had identical auditory stimuli and no visual standards. The results showed that the early components N100, P200 and N200 did not differ between tasks. This was in line with earlier results, and confirmed that activity up to 200 ms is unaffected by visual standard stimuli. The later components P250, P300 and P350 were larger and showed topographic differences in the auditory–visual oddball task. This was interpreted as reflecting separate inter-modal and intra-modal processes at later stages. In particular, the P300 and P350 components were argued to represent separate inter-modal and intra-modal components. Overall, this study provides further evidence of auditory processing occurring in two stages, an early modality-dependent stage and a later context-dependent stage.},
