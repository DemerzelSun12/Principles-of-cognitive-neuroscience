abstract = "Evoked potentials (EPs) are the electrical signals produced by the nervous system in response to an external stimulus. They are used for clinical diagnostic testing and for intraoperative monitoring. Visual, auditory, and short-latency or ‘brainstem’ auditory EPs can be used to assess sensory organs (eyes and ears) and afferent sensory pathways. Sensory EP components can be divided into latency categories, which are differentially affected by attention, cognitive tasks, and anesthesia. Motor EPs can be recorded from muscles or from the spinal cord following transcranial or direct stimulation of the brain; they are used to assess central motor pathways."

Mobile EEG leverages state-of-the-art hardware alongside established advantages of traditional EEG and recent advances in signal processing. In this review, we propose that mobile EEG could open unprecedented possibilities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. We first present a brief overview of recent developments in mobile EEG technologies, emphasising the proliferation of studies in several neuroscientific domains. As these developments have yet to be exploited by neurodevelopmentalists, we then identify three research opportunities: 1) increase in the ease and flexibility of brain data acquisition in neurodevelopmental populations; 2) integration into powerful developmentally-informative research designs; 3) development of innovative non-stationary EEG-based paradigms. Critically, we address key challenges that should be considered to fully realise the potential of mobile EEG for neurodevelopmental research and for understanding developmental psychopathology more broadly, and suggest future research directions."

  abstract           = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relation between the phase of electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha activity at stimulus onset and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a fixed-inter-stimulus interval auditory 'oddball' task, using a novel conceptualisation of orthogonal phase effects (cortical negativity versus positivity, negative driving versus positive driving, waxing versus waning). METHODS: EEG responses to button-press targets, from 14 subjects presented with 4 blocks of 150 stimuli (50% target probability), were examined. Pre-stimulus alpha activity (8-13 Hz) at Pz was assessed for each trial by digital filtering of the EEG. The alpha cycle at Pz, starting from a negative-going zero crossing, was used to sort trials into 4 phases, for which ERPs were derived from both the filtered and unfiltered EEG activity at Fz, Cz, and Pz. RESULTS: Preferred brain states in this paradigm were indicated by an 8% greater occurrence of negative driving than positive driving, and a 33% greater occurrence of waxing than waning phases. Negative driving phases were associated with increased N1 latencies and decreased N2 amplitudes. Latencies of N1 and P2 were reduced in waxing phases. These reflected systematic changes in alpha frequency and amplitude at stimulus onset. CONCLUSIONS: In a fixed-inter-stimulus interval paradigm, component frequencies of the EEG are dynamically adjusted in order to provide brain states at the moment of stimulus presentation which differentially affect the EEG correlates of stimulus processing. SIGNIFICANCE: The results add to our understanding of the genesis of the ERP, indicating the importance of the dynamic interplay between instantaneous EEG activity and stimulus processing reflected in the ERP.},

  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness and comparability of PCA-based simplifications of ERP waveforms versus their reference-free Laplacian transformations for separating task- and response-related ERP generator patterns during auditory oddball tasks.
Methods
Nose-referenced ERPs (31 sites total) were recorded from 66 right-handed adults during oddball tasks using syllables or tones. Response mode (left press, right press, silent count) and task was varied within subjects. Spherical spline current source density (CSD) waveforms were computed to sharpen ERP scalp topographies and eliminate volume-conducted contributions. ERP and CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax) to disentangle temporally and spatially overlapping ERP and CSD components.
Results
Corresponding ERP and CSD factors were unambiguously related to known ERP components. For example, the dipolar organization of a central N1 was evident from factorized anterior sinks and posterior sources encompassing the Sylvian fissure. Factors associated with N2 were characterized by asymmetric frontolateral (tonal: frontotemporal R>L) and parietotemporal (phonetic: parietotemporal L>R) sinks for targets. A single ERP factor summarized parietal P3 activity, along with an anterior negativity. In contrast, two CSD factors peaking at 360 and 560ms distinguished a parietal P3 source with an anterior sink from a centroparietal P3 source with a sharply localized Fz sink. A smaller parietal but larger left temporal P3 source was found for silent count compared to button press. Left or right press produced opposite, region-specific asymmetries originating from central sites, modulating the N2/P3 complex.
Conclusions
CSD transformation is shown to be a valuable preprocessing step for PCA of ERP data, providing a unique, physiologically meaningful solution to the ubiquitous reference problem. By reducing ERP redundancy and producing sharper, simpler topographies, and without losing or distorting any effects of interest, the CSD-PCA solution replicated and extended previous task- and response-related findings.
Significance
Eliminating ambiguities of the recording reference, the combined CSD-PCA approach systematically bridges between montage-dependent scalp potentials and distinct, anatomically-relevant current generators, and shows promise as a comprehensive, generic strategy for ERP analysis.},

Several peak latencies (P2, N2 and P3) were increased in the Parkinson group when targets were counted, whereas only N2 was delayed when targets were identified by a button press. The longer N2 latency is suggestive of an increase in the time needed to categorize stimuli.

These findings led to the conclusion that there are separate stages of auditory target processing — an early modality-specific stage and a later context-dependent stage. The present study investigated this further by simultaneously presenting a visual standard stimulus with an auditory standard stimulus in an oddball task. The aim was to determine whether the inclusion of the visual standard stimulus in this task affected the ERP to targets. The auditory–visual oddball task consisted of a regularly presented combined auditory and visual standard stimulus (80%) and an infrequent auditory target (20%). The ERPs to targets in the auditory–visual oddball task were compared to those in an auditory oddball task, which had identical auditory stimuli and no visual standards. The results showed that the early components N100, P200 and N200 did not differ between tasks. This was in line with earlier results, and confirmed that activity up to 200 ms is unaffected by visual standard stimuli. The later components P250, P300 and P350 were larger and showed topographic differences in the auditory–visual oddball task. This was interpreted as reflecting separate inter-modal and intra-modal processes at later stages. In particular, the P300 and P350 components were argued to represent separate inter-modal and intra-modal components. Overall, this study provides further evidence of auditory processing occurring in two stages, an early modality-dependent stage and a later context-dependent stage.},

  abstract = {Background
The aim of the present study was to investigate to what extent shared and distinct brain mechanisms are possibly subserving the processing of visual supra-categorical and categorical knowledge as observed with event-related potentials of the brain. Access time to these knowledge types was also investigated. Picture pairs of animals, objects, and mixed types were presented. Participants were asked to decide whether each pair contained pictures belonging to the same category (either animals or man-made objects) or to different categories by pressing one of two buttons. Response accuracy and reaction times (RTs) were also recorded.
Results
Both ERPs and RTs were grand-averaged separately for the same–different supra-categories and the animal–object categories. Behavioral performance was faster for more endomorphic pairs, i.e., animals vs. objects and same vs. different category pairs. For ERPs, a modulation of the earliest C1 and subsequent P1 responses to the same vs. different supra-category pairs, but not to the animal vs. object category pairs, was found. This finding supports the view that early afferent processing in the striate cortex can be boosted as a by-product of attention allocated to the processing of shapes and basic features that are mismatched, but not to their semantic quintessence, during same–different supra-categorical judgment. Most importantly, the fact that this processing accrual occurred independent of a traditional experimental condition requiring selective attention to a stimulus source out of the various sources addressed makes it conceivable that this processing accrual may arise from the attentional demand deriving from the alternate focusing of visual attention within and across stimulus categorical pairs’ basic structural features. Additional posterior ERP reflections of the brain more prominently processing animal category and same-category pairs were observed at the N1 and N2 levels, respectively, as well as at a late positive complex level, overall most likely related to different stages of analysis of the greater endomorphy of these shape groups. Conversely, an enhanced fronto-central and fronto-lateral N2 as well as a centro-parietal N400 to man-made objects and different-category pairs were found, possibly indexing processing of these entities’ lower endomorphy and isomorphy at the basic features and semantic levels, respectively.
Conclusion
Overall, the present ERP results revealed shared and distinct mechanisms of access to supra-categorical and categorical knowledge in the same way in which shared and distinct neural representations underlie the processing of diverse semantic categories. Additionally, they outlined the serial nature of categorical and supra-categorical representations, indicating the sequential steps of access to these separate knowledge types.},

  abstract = {In the real world, some of the auditory and visual information received by the human brain are temporally asynchronous. How is such information integrated in cognitive processing in the brain? In this paper, we aimed to study the semantic integration of differently asynchronous audio–visual information in cognitive processing using ERP (event-related potential) method. Subjects were presented with videos of real world events, in which the auditory and visual information are temporally asynchronous. When the critical action was prior to the sound, sounds incongruous with the preceding critical actions elicited a N400 effect when compared to congruous condition. This result demonstrates that semantic contextual integration indexed by N400 also applies to cognitive processing of multisensory information. In addition, the N400 effect is early in latency when contrasted with other visually induced N400 studies. It is shown that cross modal information is facilitated in time when contrasted with visual information in isolation. When the sound was prior to the critical action, a larger late positive wave was observed under the incongruous condition compared to congruous condition. P600 might represent a reanalysis process, in which the mismatch between the critical action and the preceding sound was evaluated. It is shown that environmental sound may affect the cognitive processing of a visual event.},

  abstract = {Illusory self-motion (known as vection) describes the sensation of ego-motion in the absence of physical movement. Vection typically occurs in stationary observers being exposed to visual information that suggest self-motion (e.g. simulators, virtual reality). In the present study, we tested whether sensory integration of visual information triggers vection: participants (N=13) perceived patterns of moving altered black-and-white vertical stripes on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual field. In both fields the pattern was either moving or stationary, resulting in four combinations of central and peripheral motions: (1) central and peripheral stripes moved into the same direction, (2) central and peripheral stripes moved in opposite directions, or (3) either the central or (4) the peripheral stripes were stable while the other stripes were in motion. This stimulation induced vection: Results showed significantly higher vection ratings when the stationary center of the pattern was surrounded by a moving periphery. Event-related potentials mirrored this finding: The occipital N2 was largest with stationary central and moving peripheral stripes. Our findings suggest that sensory integration of peripheral and central visual information triggers the perception of vection. Furthermore, we found evidence that neural processes precede the subjective perception of vection strength prior to the actual onset of vection. We will discuss our findings with respect to the role of stimulus eccentricity, stimulus’ depth, and neural correlates involved during the genesis of vection.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the subjective visual acuity by recording ERPs elicited by task-irrelevant visual changes. Optotypes stimuli were presented in the center of the visual field at three threshold levels (supra-threshold, threshold and sub-threshold) while participants were listening to stories. The results showed that neither vMMN nor P3a component was elicited by optotypes stimuli on the sub-threshold condition, whereas, vMMN was elicited under supra-threshold and threshold conditions, with no significant differences between those vMMN amplitudes of two conditions. The P3a amplitude was larger for supra-threshold condition than that for threshold condition. These data demonstrated that the emergence of vMMN could only reflect the automatic detection of orientation-changes in the supra-threshold and threshold conditions compared to the sub-threshold condition, whereas the P3a amplitude could reflect the difference in processing of supra-threshold and threshold stimuli.},

  abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the visual processing of actions belonging to the typical human repertoire. Two hundred and sixty coloured pictures representing persons differing in number, age and gender, engaged in simple actions, were presented to 23 right-handed students. Perception of meaningful actions (e.g., young woman trying shoes in shop) was contrasted with perception of actions lacking an understandable goal (e.g., businesswoman balancing on one foot in desert). The results indicated early recognition of comprehensible behaviour in the form of an enhanced posterior “recognition potential” (RP) (N250), which was followed by a larger negativity (N400) in response to incongruent actions. The results suggest that incoming visual information regarding human gestures is processed similarly to linguistic inputs from a conceptual point of view, thus eliciting a posterior RP when the action code is visually recognized and comprehended, and a later N400 when the action is not recognized or is difficult to integrate with previous knowledge.},
